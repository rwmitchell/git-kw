• This commit is being applied with:
  git config --global filter.kw.clean gitkwexpand
  git config --global filter.kw.smudge cat
• keywords were NOT updated on ‘stage’/clean
• git checkout -f keywords.txt : updated? keywords
• ‘Date’ keyword shows old date but mvi shows the line as being changed with original being the updated date ( ?! )

• gitkwexpand now expands MyId, not Id; allowing ‘ident’ to do its normal thing
