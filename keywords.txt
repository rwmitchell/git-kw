#ident "$Id$"
#ident "$MyId$
#ident "$Source$
#ident "$Date$

This is from: https://git-memo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git_archive.html
but there must be more to it as nothing expanded

@date    $Format: %ci$
@version $Format: %h$

  git config --global filter.kw.clean gitkwexpand
  git config --global filter.kw.smudge cat
• keywords were NOT updated on ‘stage’/clean
• git checkout -f keywords.txt : updated? keywords
• ‘Date’ keyword shows old date but mvi shows the line as being changed with original being the updated date ( ?! )

• gitkwexpand now expands MyId, not Id; allowing ‘ident’ to do its normal thing
